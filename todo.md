## Neural network architecture for finding letters as pytesseract is struggling
* Get data by picking out images and saving them to a folder - for easier logging have it named what pytesseract believes it is and modify afterwards
* Train a simple neural network (pytorch) to understand the letters

## Create an end game loop
* Game ends when wins is seen on the screen
